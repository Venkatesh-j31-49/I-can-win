First things first

Can you imagine what's about to happen?

It's Weezy the dragon, I link with the Dragons

And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'

This is what's happenin'

Second thing second, I reckon immaculate

Sound about accurate

I know that strength, it don't come without strategy

I know that sweet, it don't come without cavities

I know the passages come with some traffic

I start from the basement, end up in the attic

And third thing third

Whoever count me out, they simply can't count

Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh

Is you a believer?

I get a unicorn out of a zebra

I wear my uniform like a tuxedo

This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need a breather

Love you Miss Cita, the son of a leader

I know that bloomin' don't come without rain

I know the losin' don't come without shame

I know the beauty don't come without, huh

Hold up, hold up, last thing last

I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne

I know that losin' don't come without game

I know that beauty don't come without

Don't come without...

Pain...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer

Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

My life, my love, my drive, it came from...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last...

By the grace of the fire and the flames

You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh

The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'

Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down

It rained down, like...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer

Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

My life, my love, my drive, it came from...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
